        	<p> Beetles play a major role in the animal kingdom. Some beetles eat plants while others eat compost. 				For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer" target="_blank">Emerald Ash 				Borer</a> eats ash trees and lays eggs within it. 
             The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_beetle" target="_blank">Hercules beetle</a> starts 			off eating decomposing trees as pupa. Then they mature and add rotten fruits to their diet. 
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucanus_cervus" target="_blank">Lucanus Cervus</a> lay eggs in 				rotten stumps, which allow their offspring something to feed off of. Male Beetles wrestle other male 			beetles for mating rights and territory. This website is meant to show the beauty in the beetle world!				</p>
